# About the project
Hello everyone,
This is my dotfiles configuration, please do not copy it unless you know what
each line of code does mean.

I am currently experiencing as a poweruser, configuration and customization
may change depending on my workflow. Expect to see this repository has many
changes over times.

# Usage

ps : These dotfiles work on **Fedora Linux**. I don't know if it will
also work for other distributions.

If you would like to use my configuration, there are some requirements to make
it work as expected.

- Install kitty terminal [here](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/binary/)
- Install CaskaydiaCove NerdFont [here](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.0.2/CascadiaCode.zip),
 [preview](https://www.programmingfonts.org/#cascadia-code)
- Install DaddyTime for UI Font [here](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.0.2/DaddyTimeMono.zip),
 [preview](https://www.programmingfonts.org/#daddytimemono)
- Install nodejs (npm included) and ripgrep (installed on most linux distros)
- Install fd-finder [here](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd)
- Install packer plugin manager (not bootstrapping because I have some problems with it) [here](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)
- Configure ssh key for github authentification [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)
- Install fish, fisher, tide for shell configuration

# Notes
- The fonts files must be copied to $HOME/usr/share/fonts path to be used.
- I will stick with fedora because it serves me more on my workflow and everyday
use than Arch Linux. No need to be in arch to be a poweruser on Linux.
- I'm still figuring out how to use keybindings on plasma for better workflow.

# To-Do
- make lsp work perfectly for every file extension
- make telescope work
- migrating from packer to lazy plugin manager
- get used to fish shell


If you want to get the latest updates of the repo, don't forget to star it.

Thanks for reading,
Yushi
