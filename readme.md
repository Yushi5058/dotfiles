# About the project
Hello everyone,
This is my dotfiles configuration, please do not copy it unless you know what
each line of code does mean.

I am currently experiencing as a poweruser, configuration and customization
may change depending on my workflow. Expect to see this repository has many
changes over times.

# Usage

ps : These dotfiles work on **Debian 12. I don't know if it will
also work for other distributions**

If you would like to use my configuration, there are some requirements to make
it work as expected.

- Install kitty terminal [here](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/binary/)
- Install tmux [here](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Installing)
- Install hack nerdfont [here](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)
- Install npm, ripgrep, node js
- Configure ssh key for github authentification and gpg for signing commits
- Install nunito font for personal use, italic one

# Notes
- I installed neovim from the releases page on github because the apt installer
hasn't the lastest version release, so I can avoid potential breakes and bugs.
- I also stored my ssh and gpg keyphrase in Kwallet so I don't have to do
over again. It's so annoying, but we do with what we have.
- Overall debian apt installer might not have the latest versions of the requirements
made above so be sure to verify the version of each one and install the lastest
from the releases pages of their website or github repo to avoid bugs.
- The repo is having many changes over time depending on my workflow.

*ps : I used Hack font in my kitty.conf file configuration. If you would like
another font (Firacode for example), then download FiraCode NerdFont and move
the files in fonts config file location and change the name in kitty.conf from
Hack to FiraCode*

If you want to get the latest updates of the repo, don't forget to star it.

Thanks for reading,
Yushi
