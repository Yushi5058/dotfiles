# About the project
Hello everyone,
This is my dotfiles configuration, please do not copy it unless you know what
each line of code does mean.

I am currently experiencing as a poweruser, configuration and customization
may change depending on my workflow. Expect to see this repository has many
changes over times.

# Usage

ps : These dotfiles work on **Arch Linux**. I don't know if it will
also work for other distributions.

If you would like to use my configuration, there are some requirements to make
it work as expected.

- Install kitty terminal [here](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/binary/)
- Install tmux [here](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Installing) { Optional: I'm not currently using tmux in my workflow.}

# Notes
- I still don't know how to add keybindings to manage brightness of my screen
- waybar customization, swaylock config and some sway keybindings were inspired
by these [dotfiles](https://github.com/dpgraham4401/.dotfiles)
- waybar customization isn't perfect. I'm not yet satisfied with it. Planning to
add more details for more readability.


If you want to get the latest updates of the repo, don't forget to star it.

Thanks for reading,
Yushi
