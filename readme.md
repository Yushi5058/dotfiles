# About the project 
Hello everyone,
This is my dotfiles configuration, please do not copy it unless you know what
each line of code does mean.

I am actually experiencing this .dotfiles thing, so any feedback on my work
will be greatly appreciated. 

# Usage 

If you would like to use my configuration, that I don't recommend if you 
are searching for a good and featureful / updated one, you just have to clone 
this repository and copy / paste it in you .config files.

# Contact 

For feedback & issues, don't hesitate to open pull requests or issues.
You can also contact me [here](yushi_61@proton.me) or in 
[discord](discord.com/users/1071758711330193478)


Thanks for reading,
Yushi
