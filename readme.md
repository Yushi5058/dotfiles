# About the project 
Hello everyone,
This is my dotfiles configuration, please do not copy it unless you know what
each line of code does mean.

I am currently experiencing as a poweruser, configuration and customization
may change depending on my workflow. Expect to see this repository has many
changes over times.

# Usage 

ps : These dotfiles work on **Debian 12. I don't know if it will 
also work for other distributions**

If you would like to use my configuration, there are some requirements to make 
it work as expected.

- Install oh-my-bash framework [here](https://ohmybash.nntoan.com/)
- Install kitty terminal [here](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/binary/)
- Install tmux [here](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Installing)
- Install hack nerdfont [here](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)
- Install npm, ripgrep, node js
- Configure ssh and gpg keys for github 
- Install nunito font for personal use, italic one

*ps : I used Hack font in my kitty.conf file configuration. If you would like
another font (Firacode for example), then download FiraCode NerdFont and move
the files in fonts config file location and change the name in kitty.conf from
Hack to FiraCode*

If you want to get the latest updates of the repo, don't forget to star it.

Thanks for reading,
Yushi
