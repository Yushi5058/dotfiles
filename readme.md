# About the project
Hello everyone,
This is my dotfiles configuration, please do not copy it unless you know what
each line of code does mean.

I am currently experiencing as a poweruser, configuration and customization
may change depending on my workflow. Expect to see this repository has many
changes over times.

# Usage

ps : These dotfiles work on **Fedora 38**. I don't know if it will
also work for other distributions.

If you would like to use my configuration, there are some requirements to make
it work as expected.

- Install kitty terminal [here](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/binary/)
- Install tmux [here](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Installing) { Optional: I'm not currently using tmux in my workflow.}
- Install CaskaydiaCove NerdFont [here](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.0.2/CascadiaCode.zip), 
 [preview](https://www.programmingfonts.org/#cascadia-code)
- Install nodejs (npm included) and ripgrep (installed on most linux distros)
- Install fd-finder [here](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd)
- Install packer plugin manager (not bootstrapping because I have some problems with it) [here](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)
- Configure ssh key for github authentification [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)
- Catpuccin kde theme [here](https://github.com/catppuccin/kde), make sure to have lightly installed [here](https://github.com/Luwx/Lightly)
*Note*: I use Frapp√© theme and sapphire accent
- For icons, install tela icon theme [here](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Tela-icon-theme). 
*Note*: I use tela dark icon theme

# Notes
- I changed from debian to fedora again for personal preference and because fedora has much more stable apps than debian does. I also didn't change the base font (Noto Sans) for my linux workflow. 
- I changed from hack NerdFont to CaskaydiaCove NerdFont for much more readibility
- I don't use gpg for verifying and signing commits anymore, for the moment as I don't really need to. Maybe I will have another opinion about it in the future
- My entire workflow system is based on the catpuccin theme for personal preference and because I like it
- Fonts downloaded must be copied to `$HOME/usr/share/fonts`
- The repo is having many changes over time depending on my workflow.


If you want to get the latest updates of the repo, don't forget to star it.

Thanks for reading,
Yushi
